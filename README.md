## Research Interests

My research bridges theoretical computer science and systems engineering, developing formal models and results that translate to practical performance improvements. The most impactful systems work is grounded in rigorous theory, and the most impactful theory work is motivated by real systems problems. My research demonstrates that provable guarantees (correctness, security, performance bounds) can be achieved without sacrificing practical efficiency, often leading to measurable performance improvements at the scale of multiple orders of magnitude. 

Over the past 2 years, I have been focusing on ML performance and robustness. On the ML performance side, this includes optimizing both ML inference and training, along with training and using Agentic AI to solve research-level systems problems. In the ML robustness space, I am interesting the Adversarial AI both from a theory lens and a systems lens, I have worked on building a zero-trust gateway for AI infrastructure, finding security solutions for AI/ML vulnerabilites, and monitoring + auditing the runtime behavior of agents.

## Short Bio
I have held staff-level, senior-level, and research engineering roles at multiple tech companies including (most recently) a seed-stage MIT startup focusing on ML for Systems, as well as Stripe, Google, and Bloomberg. I am also the Co-founder and CTO of Dorcha, a company specializing in AI security and privacy. I obtained an M.S. in Computer Science focusing on Networks \& Systems from Harvard with a 4.0 GPA. I also hold an M.S. in Cybersecurity focusing on CS Theory \& Cryptography from the City College of New York with a 4.0 GPA. I was also a visiting student at MIT for one semester, where I completed 6.829 with an A grade, and an adjunct professor at Adrian College where I taught an advanced-undergrad course focusing on ML and Systems engineering.
