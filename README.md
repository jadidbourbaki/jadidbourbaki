My research bridges the beautiful and mathematically rigorous world of CS Theory with the messy dark art of implementing high-performance systems that can scale. My work demonstrates that provable guarantees (correctness, security, performance bounds) can be achieved without sacrificing practical efficiency, often leading to measurable performance improvements at the scale of multiple orders of magnitude. Recently, I'm focused on ML performance. This includes optimizing both ML inference and training, along with training and using Agentic AI to solve research-level systems problems. I am also interested in Adversarial AI. I built out a zero-trust gateway for AI infrastructure, and am finding security solutions for AI/ML vulnerabilites.

## Biographical Sketch

**Research Background**: I obtained an M.S. in Computer Science from Harvard with a 4.0 GPA. At Harvard, I was advised by [Dr. Minlan Yu](https://minlanyu.seas.harvard.edu/). I have a second M.S. in Cybersecurity from the City College of New York with a 4.0 GPA, where I was advised by [Dr. Allison Bishop](https://www.thecomputersciencecomedian.com/). I was also a visiting student at MIT, where I completed [6.829](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-829-computer-networks-fall-2002/) with an A grade. 

**Industry Background**: I am currently a Member of Technical Staff at a seed-stage MIT startup focusing on ML for Systems. In the past, I have held senior-level engineering roles and research roles at multiple tech companies including Stripe, Google, and Bloomberg. I am also the co-founder and CTO of [Dorcha](https://getdorcha.com/), a company specializing in AI security and privacy. 

**Teaching Background**: I designed [assignments](https://github.com/jadidbourbaki/adversarial-ai-assignments) for [Allison Bishop](https://www.thecomputersciencecomedian.com/)’s graduate-level Adversarial AI course at the City College of New York. For Fall 2025, I was an adjunct professor at Adrian College, teaching an advanced-undergrad course focused on Systems + ML. I was a Teaching Fellow at Harvard for the course CS 145: Networking at Scale.
