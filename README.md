## 🔬 Research Interests

I work at the intersection of **cryptography**, **security**, and **systems**, with particular focus on:

- **Adversarial Machine Learning & Cryptography**: Developing ML-augmented data structures with provable security guarantees
- **Privacy-Preserving Systems**: Differential privacy, secure logging, and privacy models for learned data structures  
- **High-Performance Systems**: Database acceleration, distributed systems, and network programmability
- **Applied Cryptography**: Zero-trust architectures, protocol design, and novel entropy sources

I'm actively seeking
- **PhD opportunities** in cryptography, security, or systems.
- **Research collaborations** on adversarial ML, privacy-preserving systems, or applied crypto
